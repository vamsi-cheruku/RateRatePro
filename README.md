# RateRateProf

The RateRateProf (RRP) website allows users to provide feedback on professors' teaching performance, styles, and courses. The system offers three distinct advantages over traditional rating systems:
  - Advanced, user-friendly data visualisation.
  - Enhanced rating effectiveness by filtering irrelevant comments.
  - The ability to compare professors side by side.

  - **Student Users**: Can rate professors, search for, and view rating data for any professor.
  - **Non-Student Users**: Can search for and view rating data for any professor.
